The RoMow is a robot containing a Raspberry Pi and an Arduino. 
The Raspberry Pi gets dimensions of a yard.
The Arduino recieves signals from the 4 different sensors on the robot.
There are 2 acoustic sensors and 2 IR sensors.
The IR Sensors are testing what is in front of the bot and if that bot is on the ground.
The acoustic sensors are used to detect objects around the bot.

The functions implemented on the bot so far:
  Going Straight
  Turning left or right about a wheel
  Turning the 12V Weed Whacker motor on or off depending on the bot being on the ground.
  Stopping the bot when the front IR Sensor is activated.

This project is worked on by 4 Mechatronic Students at the California State University Channel Islands. It is a
